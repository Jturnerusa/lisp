An interpreter for a custom lisp dialect.

* Ideas
The core language should be as simple as possible, complex features should be implemented in terms
of the primitives where possible and reasonable. Let can be implemented with lambda, loops
can be implemented with recusion, etc.

* Differences
This lisp is intended to be similar to Emacs lisp, but functions and values are unified into a single
namespace like in scheme.

There is only one equality function, "=", no eq, eql, equal, etc.

* Limitations
This language is very unstable and many things are not implemented yet.
